I wanted to create my personal website mainly because I was looking for a way to get practical experiance with CSS/HTML and web dev in general. I ended up going deep
into the topic and studying web development in order to make the website that I can be praud of a developer in the upcoming years. Additionally, I wanted to express my
passions in some of the hobies which hopefully can make a better impression of me as a person.
