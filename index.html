               <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio.</p>

               <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software at Northeastern University. <br> I have accumulated nearly 2 years of experience as a developer and am currently working as a Junior Software Developer for MLM Soft.</p>
               
               <p>I discovered my passion for software development at the age of 12. I appreciate the freedom it offers and the fact that it is both technical and artistic.</p>
               
               <p>Despite facing hardships, such as moving to the US with no language skills in 2017, becoming a foster child, and being unable to attend a good high school due to financial difficulties, I persevered. I graduated at the top of my class, gained admission to Northeastern University, and started proving myself as a capable developer with strong work ethics and the ability to produce quality code within tight deadlines.</p>
               
               <p>In this portfolio, I will delve deep into my experiences, projects, skills, and hobbies, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of who I am as both a developer and a person.</p>

                    <p>I first got an opportunity to apply my java, SQL, and XMl skills in this new app by builing a first version of it
                        and then handing it over to a future full-stack developer that was planned to be hired. In a few weeks I familizised myself with the OOD principels
                    and basic app development principels and ended up coming with the current version of the app. The contactor liked the results and ended up taking me
                as a lead developer to finish the app and launch it in all the platforms. It is still in the early stages of the developmetn but we are expecting launching it in the next month.  </p>

                    <p>For the culminating project in my Object-Oriented Design course, our professor challenged us to develop a battleship application. This engaging app was designed for student play, 
                        incorporating interactions with the university server. Beyond the creation of a fully functional game, our task extended to implementing an algorithm that would function as a player, 
                        interacting with algorithms crafted by fellow students to determine their effectiveness. Over the course of a collaborative week, my team and I successfully secured a position within the top 
                        10 among 300 students in the class. The project offered valuable hands-on experience in the application of MVC principles, effective collaboration via GitHub, navigating teamwork dynamics, 
                        and delivering high-quality code within demanding time constraints.</p>

    This calendar aimed to integrate a variety of features, including layout changes, task management, the calendar itself, 
    reminders, and several other functionalities. The project spanned a duration of two weeks, resulting in a codebase exceeding 4,000 lines upon completion.</p>

                    • Created Data Set with Java: Utilized Java to create a data set within the app which consisted of all the available exercises on all the muscle groups and marked with the appropriate level in order for the AI to determine which split is the best. <br>
                    • Leveraged ChatGPT API for personalized workout splits: Employing the ChatGPT API, I collected user parameters via a questionnaire and utilized a premade template with personalized adjustments. Upon receiving the response, I displayed the custom workout split tailored to each user.<br>
                    • Integrated YouTube API for exercise video display: Utilized the YouTube API to embed exercise videos within the app alongside the workout split.

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">I became really obsessed with this one. It all started with converting my small commuter bike into a 42V 2000W ebike, which was meant to get me from A to B. However, I lost my mind when I stumbled upon Alibaba ebikes that were beautiful in performance and aesthetics.

                I was drawn to the idea of a simple and budget-friendly design that could replace a car, allowing for comfortable commuting over long distances with minimal carbon emissions. I even started an Instagram page offering to convert regular bikes into ebikes. This was within legal limits since they wouldn't exceed 20mph, unless... you left the public roads and removed the limiter. I got as crazy as building a bike that outputted more than 12,000 watts of power.
                
                I still curse Alibaba for showing me those ebikes, but it led me on an interesting route where I learned a good deal about electrical and mechanical engineering while working on these bikes in my basement. I even learned welding, which was quite a contrast from my usual days spent coding at a clean desk, now attempting to weld two pieces of metal together while getting sunburned.
                
                I still use my bike occasionally for long distances to save time and would definitely consider getting into making electric vehicles as a hobby, or maybe even as a software developer in the future.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;">I lost my mind in this game. As someone who has practiced MMA extensively, I can currently attest that it is much easier to land a blow on an opponent than it is to consistently hit a golf ball. The intricacies of golf bear a striking resemblance to the challenges of coding. In both endeavors, mastery comes through relentless practice and meticulous attention to detail.

                    In the realm of coding, every line of code written demands precision; a single misplaced character can lead to errors, much like a slight miscalculation in a golf swing resulting in a wayward shot. The process of coding mirrors the iterative nature of golf; just as a golfer refines their swing through countless repetitions, a coder hones their skills through continuous refinement of their codebase.
                    
                    Despite the frustrations and setbacks, both coding and golf offer a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Each successful line of code or well-executed shot on the course serves as a testament to the perseverance and dedication required to excel in these pursuits.
                    
                    I've reached a level of proficiency with my $20 driver from Goodwill, hitting it 320 yards, which is considered elite in the golfing world. Now, I'm striving for a similar level of mastery in coding, aiming to showcase my skills through innovative projects and solutions.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px;">This one is the most special. I was an athlete for a long time, but with time I realized that if I wanted to go all-in in the sport, I would need to sacrifice my health and basically my life for it in order to be the best at it. That's what happened to me in MMA. I was on my way to have my first amateur fight, but was badly injured during training—a specific illegal knee to the face. The fight was canceled, and it was finals week as well. I noticed a slight decrease in my cognitive functions; I would forget simple things on exams and have a hard time going over the code while holding different recursive calls in my head.

                    While recovering and finishing my first year at Northeastern, I understood that it's not a good path to take because being an MMA fighter and a software developer will not work well together. Losing too many brain cells will not support my true passion for coding in any way. But it taught me the unbreakable discipline that I apply when I'm too tired to code. I would still sit and do it because once I would get up and go to the gym. The only way to win was through repetition and consistency.
                    
                    So yeah, now, I just work out every morning exactly at 6 am because I like the progress and consistency that it gives me.</p>
