               <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio.
                <br> Currently, I'm finishing Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Sciene with a concentration in Software. <br>
                I occumulated nearly 3 years of experiance in being a developer and currently working as a Junior Software Developer for MLM Soft. <br>
                I knew I wanted to be a software developer since I was 12 years old because I enjoyed the freedom and the fact it is eqully as techincal as it is an art to be a programmer. <br>
                Experiancing hardships in life like moving to US with no language in 2017, becoming a foster child and not being able to attend a good high school due to financial difficulties <br>
                I was able to graduate at the top of my class, get into Northeastern, and proof myself as a worthy developer with strong wotk ethics and ability to produce quality code within tight deadlines.<br>
                I will got deep into my experiances, projects, and hobbies that will give you a good undestanding of who I am as a developer and a person.
