               <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio.</p>

               <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software at Northeastern University. <br> I have accumulated nearly 3 years of experience as a developer and am currently working as a Junior Software Developer for MLM Soft.</p>
               
               <p>I discovered my passion for software development at the age of 12. I appreciate the freedom it offers and the fact that it is both technical and artistic.</p>
               
               <p>Despite facing hardships, such as moving to the US with no language skills in 2017, becoming a foster child, and being unable to attend a good high school due to financial difficulties, I persevered. I graduated at the top of my class, gained admission to Northeastern, and proved myself as a capable developer with strong work ethics and the ability to produce quality code within tight deadlines.</p>
               
               <p>In this portfolio, I will delve deep into my experiences, projects, and hobbies, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of who I am as both a developer and a person.</p>
